     <h2>About me</h2>
     <p>Welcome! I am a computer science Student at Robert Gordon University in Scotland.
     It is an amazing opportunity to master my languages with very ethniocally diverse Uni-societies.
   Also I find my course very interesting, mostly thanks to great support of tutors and my peers.</p>

    <p>For many years I have been interested in technology, programming and video edit.
      In 2012 I have co-founded EditVcoM, a digital, online film production company.
      I managed to edit tens of different movie types from melancholic to dynamic,
      with use of footage filmed by myself or provided by customers.</p>

      <p>Additionally, since I was 12 I have also been leading regular workshops
        on “CashFlow 101” game that teaches the basis of personal financing to
        university students. In 2015, as a 16-year old I was invited by the AEGEE
         group to Cracow to lead a “CashFlow” sessions in English to an international
         group of college students. </p>

         <p>I have also been inspired by different entrepreneurs I had a chance to meet and learn from.
           I made a point of regularly attending the Warsaw Startup Weekends,
           which gave me an opportunity to participate in business workshops,
           learn about ideas refining and pitching, and
           then working towards developing products in multidisciplinary teams of programmers,
            designers and salesmen.</p>
    
    <p>I hope you will enjoy my site!</p>
